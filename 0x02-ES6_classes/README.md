# ES6 Classes

Classes are a blueprint for creating objects, which encapsulate data and methods.
With ES6 classes, developers can define class constructors, properties, and methods. Classes also support inheritance, which allows developers to create subclasses that inherit properties and methods from a parent class. This makes it easier to organize and maintain code, and allows for the creation of reusable components.
